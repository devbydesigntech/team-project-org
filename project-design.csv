Project,,,,,,,,
"Create a REST API service that allows their employees to give reviews of the projects they’re working on, their team members and manager. It should fulfil the following requirements:

- [ ] > The org has multiple teams. Each team is made up a manager and multiple associates
- [ ] > A team can be working on multiple projects at any point in time. Also multiple teams can collaborate on a project.
- [ ] > Executives in the company have access to all projects. Only this role can add users to the company, create projects, teams & assign users to teams/roles. They see all reviews and can delete if they wish but can’t edit.
- [ ] > Managers or associates can take on a temporary internal advisory role on another Team’s project
- [ ] > All users can delete/edit the reviews they made.
- [ ] > Associates can see reviews of their team’s projects & themselves.
- [ ] > Managers can see reviews of themselves, their team members & their projects.
- [ ] > Internal advisors can see the project reviews. They can also leave a review.
- [ ] > Only executives can see the name of the reviewer

All endpoints should return a JSON response.",,,,,,,,
